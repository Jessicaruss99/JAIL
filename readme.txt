Description
JAILBREAK is a single player maze puzzle game, available on PC and intended for teens.
Throughout this game, the player acts as a prisoner escaping space jail through a series of mazes. Throughout these mazes they have to 
escape the prison, go through sewers, and finally get off the planet. Throughout the game the player will pick up a series of colorful
keycards that are needed for escape. They are hidden throughout the mazes and you need to collect all of them to get through the last gate 
in the last maze. We know not all players will explore every avenue in a single maze the first time, so the player always has the ability 
to go back into previous mazes. In addition to this, the last gate/door will ask for a series of key cards in a specific color order and afterwards
a pin. The player will have to determine this pin based on the color order of the keycards and the hidden color coded numbers they can see throughout the mazes.
Once they enter all key cards and the pin, they win the game. If they get caught by the prison guards, they lose an escape attempt. Lose a
all escape attempts and you lose the game.
